This document is meant for package developers wanting to submit an organism
which does not already exist in \Biocpkg{Seqnames}, to be a part of 
\Biocpkg{Seqnames}. 

\section{Background}

\Biocpkg{Seqnames} provides a multitude of functions to subset and access 
seqName mappings and styles associated with an organism. One can use 
the supplementary manual "Seqnames.pdf" to see such functions. Alternately 
if there is no support for an organism for one's choice, one can submit a tab
delimited file (as detailed by the sections below) to request their favorite
organism to become a part of Seqnames package.

\section{Support for existing organisms}
Seqnames already provides support for a multitude of organisms, to see a
detailed list of organism and the supported seqname styles associated with 
those organism, one can simply run :

<<verbatim, message=FALSE>>=
library(Seqnames)
names(supportedStyles())
@

\section{File format for new organism}
If your favorite organism does not exist in the above list, one can submit 
a tab-delimited file in the following format and request for your organism
to be added to \Biocpkg{Seqnames}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The file name should be in the following format:
   \file{genus\_{}species.txt}
\item The columns should be tab-delimited in the following order
\begin{itemize}
 \item linear 
 \item auto
 \item sex
 \item 1 column per seqname style and 1 row per chromosome 
    name (not all chromosomes of a given organism necessarily belong to 
    the mapping)
    where linear denotes all the linear chromosomes, auto denotes all the 
    autosomes and sex denotes all the allosomes or sex chromosomes. 
\end{itemize}
\item The entries should be in T/F format for columns linear, auto and sex.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example File}
One can look at existing organism files under Seqnames/extdata/dataFiles
in their R/library to get a further idea about the format of files.
