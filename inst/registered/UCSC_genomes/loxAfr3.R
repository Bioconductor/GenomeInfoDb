    ## This means that the scaffold_750 sequence in one is not the same as
    ## the scaffold_750 sequence in the other so we must not map them.
    ## We also assume that scaffold_750 in loxAfr3 is an "unplaced-scaffold"
    ## (and not an "unlocalized-scaffold" like reported in Loxafr3.0) so it's
    ## no different from all the other scaffolds in the assembly.
